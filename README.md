# End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) server

This is a server for storage of encrypted files. It provides REST API for user accounts, data storage, and sharing information between users. The client is available at https://github.com/xlab-si/e2ee-client.

*NOTE*: E2EE server is a work in progress. There are issues to be fixed, for example database scheme and authentication (currently, the tokens are used and are issued by the server itself). 

### 1.) Prerequisites
In order to get E2EE server up and running, you will need the following:
* golang
* redis
* postgresql

#### Golang
Install Golang and setup the GOPATH environment variable, for instance:
```sh
$ mkdir ~/goworkspace
$ export GOPATH=$HOME/goworkspace
```

You can then fetch this repository and all its dependencies by running
```sh
$ go get github.com/xlab-si/e2ee-server
```
#### Redis
Redis is used for storing expired tokens, the password needs to be changed and set (see core/redis/redis_cli.go):
`CONFIG SET requirepass "some_password"`

#### Postgresql
Install PostgreSQL and create database e2ee:
`CREATE DATABASE e2ee;`. Depending on what OS distribution you are running, you might also have to run `ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'postgres';`. For details, see db/db.go

### 2.) Configure key, certificate and paths
Every environment (testing, preproduction, production) can be configured via appropriate .json configuration files residing in the settings/ folder. By default, server certificate and key are stored in the keys/ subfolder. You should generate new certificate and key for your server and update .json files to point to the locations where certificate and key are stored.

### 3.) Compile, test and run
Navigate to your $GOPATH/src/github.com/xlab-si/e2ee-server directory and run
```sh
$ go install
```
This will put the _e2ee-server_ executable in your $GOPATH/bin. For convenience, you can run
```sh
$ export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin 
```
and you will be able to run E2EE server from arbitrary location with `./e2ee-server`.

#### Running tests
Before starting E2EE server, it is advisable to run tests to check whether everything is working properly. Navigate to the tests/ directory and from both subdirectories (api_tests/ and unit_tests/) run
```sh
$ go test
```
